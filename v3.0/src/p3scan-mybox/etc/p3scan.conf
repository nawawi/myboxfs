#
#  P3Scan Version 3.0
#
#  (C) 2003-2006 by Jack S. Lai <laitcg at gmail dot com>
#
#  All options are set to default unless un-commented below:

# At a minimum, the following options should be checked or set:
#
# Scanner Type                      scannertype =
# Virusscanner                      scanner =
# Regular Expression for Virusname  virusregexp =
#
# If the clamav library was available and p3scan was compiled with it (default)
# then nothing needs to be set from their defaults. You should still go through
# this configuration file and determine if any special options meet your needs.

#
# Alternate virus notification email
#
#   In the event you wish to modify the virus notification email on the
#   fly, as in using the bash scanner, uncomment this to allow a copy of the
#   p3scan.mail virus template to be placed in:
#   :virusdir/<pid>/vnmsg
#
#   default: use template defined in template= w/out modification.
#
# altvnmsg

#
# Authorized User
#
#   When using the Useurl feature, this enables only those users specified
#   by an entry located at :sysconfdir/p3scan/users/USER#SERVER:PORT to
#   use p3scan.
#
#   Sample:
#     :sysconfdir/p3scan/users/lulu@domain.com#pop3.domain.com:110
#
#  default: none
#
# authuser

#
# Blacklist Short
#
#   Normally p3scan will send a virus alert type message for
#   email addresses found in :sysconfdir/p3scan/p3scan.blacklist.
#
#   When this option is enabled, the client will get a message
#   from p3scan with a subject line and nothing in the body.
#
#   default: send a full parameter blacklist notification message.
#
# blackshort

#
# Blacklist Subject
#
#   This option can be used to change the default subject line when reporting
#   a blacklisted message. In the default below, everything between the
#   quotes can be changed and are not part of the actual default subject line
#   and <address> will be replaced by the actual name of the blacklisted
#   address.
#
#   default: Subject: "[Blacklisted] mail to you:" <address>
#
# blacksubj =

#
# Broken email clients
#
#   Some email clients may require special processing. If this
#   option is enabled the client will receive whole lines (vice
#   single characters) while processing a large email message.
#
#   The reason for leaving two types of large email processing
#   is that when this option is disabled, the possibility exists
#   that the client will not see any "X-P3Scan: Due to an
#   extremely large attachment you see this message line." in
#   the received message header.
#
#   Note: As of the introduction of this parameter, only some
#   instances of the use of the Outlook/Outlook Express clients
#   warrent enabling of this feature.
#
#   default: send characters during large message processing.
#
# broken

# Enable Spam checking
#
#  If set, will scan for Spam before scanning for a virus.
#
#  P3scan has been tested with both dspam-3.0.0-rc2 and
#  Mail::SpamAssassin v2.6.
#
#  The DSPAM implementation uses the virtual-users capability
#  of the mysql backend to dspam. Mysql is the recommended
#  interface due to speed and stability (and in our case, the
#  virtual-users interface).
#
#  P3scan and SpamAssassin uses the interface spamd/spamc.
#  You should start spamd before running p3scan. For example:
#  "spamd -L -d" (run in local mode only, daemonize)
#  man spamd for more information.
#
#  default: no checking of spam
#
# Sample: Mail::SpamAssassin
# checkspam = /usr/bin/spamc
# Sample: DSPAM (single user)
# checkspam = /usr/bin/dspam --user mail --mode=teft --stdout --deliver=innocent,spam --feature=ch,no,wh
# Sample: DSPAM (virtual user)
# checkspam = /usr/bin/dspam --user dspamuser --mode=teft --stdout --deliver=innocent,spam --feature=ch,no,wh
# Of course change the options in the above lines to your preferences.

#
# Clean Kill
#
#   To allow a child process to kill the parent (thereby terminating
#   p3scan) when the number of children == zero (no more processes
#   will be allowed to start) when an EMERGENCY error is encountered,
#   enable this option.
#
#   EMERGENCY errors are those like no disk space, cannot access virus
#   template files, etc...
#
#   NOTE: Not having this set can cause continuous errors (and associated
#   email) to be reported as new children attempt the same function. See
#   :P3DOCS/p3scan-:version/README-emergency
#   for a list of errors that may cause termination.
#
#   default: report error, kill child, but continue main.
#
# cleankill

#
# Debug
#
#   Turn on debugging. The recommended debug procedure is to
#   call p3scan as follows:
#      p3scan -d > debug 2>&1
#   This will trap debug information to the file "debug".
#   You can then monitor it with a `tail` command.
#
#   default: off
#
# debug

#
# Debug-IMAP
#
#   When in debug mode, display IMAP commands.
#
#   default: off (as it can be very "noisy" during debug :) )
#
# debug-imap

#
# Debug-Memory
#
#   When in debug mode, display memory usage also.
#
#   default: off
#
# debug-memory

#
# Debug-Message
#
#   When in debug mode, this will display the incoming, raw message.
#
#   default: off
#
# debug-message

#
# Debug-Scanning
#
#   When in debug mode, this will display the message during each scanning
#   procedure.
#
#   default: off
#
# debug-scanning

#
# Debug-SMTP
#
#   When in debug mode, this will display smtp commands.
#
#   default: off
#
# debug-smtp

#
# Delete
#
#  Instead of keeping an infected message in the Virus Directory, delete
#  it after reporting it to the user.
#
#  default: Keep infected messages in $virusdir
#
# delete

#
# Delete Notify
#
#   This option can be used to change the default file deleted notification
#   that is displayed in the virus notification message when the "delete"
#   option is used.
#
#   default: Per instruction, the message has been deleted.
#
# delnotify =

#
# deMIME Setting
#
#   Uncomment this if we should parse all MIME-sections instead of passing
#   the message as-is to the scanner. This is used for viruscanners that cannot
#   natively handle email attachments. This option uses PLDaniels ripMIME
#   library to perform the parsing function.
#
#   NOTE: As of this writing, ClamAV does not require this setting. If your
#         Anti-Virus program states it can handle email, then this option
#         is normally not needed.
#
#   NOTE: This option is not available when p3scan is compiled with the
#         "--disable-ripmime" option. See p3scan -h to check for this.
#
#   default: <no demime>
#
# demime

#
# Emergency Contact
#
#  When an EMERGENCY error occurs, the contacts listed here will be sent
#  an email message about the problem.
#
#  default: root@localhost postmaster@localhost
#
# emergcon = root@localhost

#
# Extra Notification Recipient
#
#  When an infection message is sent to the client, send a copy of the
#  message to the address specified here.
#
#  default: Do not notify anyone else
#
# extra = root@localhost

#
# Extra Notification Recipient mail program
#
#  Use this program to send Extra Notification messages.
#
#  default: /bin/mail
#
# extrapgm =

#
# Insert SMTP message virus scanner information.
#
#   This option is used to add the virus definition info from your scanner
#   to an smtp message. It will only be added as a footer if the message
#   is not signed cryptographically and is only a text message.
#
#   It is used in conjunction with the file :sysconfdir/p3scan/p3scan.footer
#   in the following fashion:
#
#   :sysconfdir/p3scan/p3scan.footer:
#
#   1) If file does not exist and "footer" is defined:
#      No footer information will added to outgoing messages, but the p3scan
#      version and scanner info will be added to the header.
#
#   2) If file exists but blank and "footer" is defined:
#      P3Scan version/host info and scanner info will be added to end of
#      message and header.
#
#   3) If file contains information and "footer" is defined:
#      All lines of this file will be added to the end of the smtp message and
#      then p3scan version/host info and scanner info will be appended.
#
#   4) If file does not exist and "footer" is not defined:
#      P3Scan will only insert p3scan version info into the header.
#
#   default: option 1 (if --disable-clamav used for compile, then the
#                      default will be option 4)
#
# Sample: FRISK F-Prot Antivirus:
# footer = /usr/local/bin/f-prot -verno
# Sample: ClamAV:
# footer = /usr/bin/clamdscan -V

#
# Free space
#
#   The number of KB's there must be free before processing any mail.
#   If there is less than this amount, p3scan will terminate any
#   connections until the problem is resolved.
#
#   NOTE: p3scan could need (2 * msgsize) * children disk space free.
#         Being this is dynamic (not all space is needed all the time),
#         you should ensure you have more than enough disk space.
#
#   default: freespace = 10000 (10MB)
#
# Sample: If you want to ensure 100MB are free
# freespace = 100000

#
# Good Scanner return codes
#
#   Some scanners can report more than good or infected. Place valid return
#   codes here that will enable the message to be delivered without a
#   warning. For example, Kaspersky Anti-Virus reports code 10 for an
#   encrypted .zip file.
#
#   default: none
#
# Sample: goodcode = 10
# goodcode =

#
# IP Address
#
#   The IP Address we listen on
#
#   default: 0.0.0.0 (any address)
#
# ip = 127.0.0.1

#
# IMAP Port
#
#   Check for IMAP protocol on a different port.
#
#   default: 143
#
# imapport = 220

#
# ISP Spam
#
#   This option allows you to set the string your ISP uses if
#   it processes your email for SPAM. If this string is found
#   in the subject line of the incoming message, it will not
#   perform any spam processing so that the message gets to
#   the client faster.
#
#   default: none
#
# Sample for cox.net:
# ispspam = -- Spam --
#
# ispspam =

#
# LogOpt
#
#   The syslog option of one or more parameters (man 3 syslog) OR'd
#   together to form a single integer.
#
#   Examples: LOG_PID|LOG_CONS|LOG_PERROR = 35
#             LOG_PID|LOG_CONS = 3
#
#   default: 3
#
# logopt = 3

#
#  LogFac
#
#   The type of program that is logging. There are many options
#   (man 3 syslog) but we will normally only use LOG_DAEMON.
#
#   Examples: LOG_DAEMON = 24
#             LOG_USER   = 8
#
#   default: 24
#
# logfac = 24

#
# Max Child's
#
#   The maximum number of connections we will handle at once. Any further
#   connections will be dropped. Keep in mind that a number of 10 also
#   means that 10 scanners can run at once.
#
#   default: 10
#
# maxchilds = 10

#
# No End Of Message marker
#
#   Give your email processing programs a file that does not contain an
#   EOM marker (".") so your anti-virus scanner will not choke on email.
#
#   default: do not remove eom marker from message
#
# noeom

#
# No Spam Pipe
#
#   Give your spam processing program a filename vice sending it data via
#   pipe or redirect.
#
#   default: use a redirect
#
# nospampipe

#
# Notify Directory
#
#   Create notification mails in <DIR>. Also used for temporary storage.
#
#  default: :localstatedir/spool/p3scan/notify
#
# notifydir = :localstatedir/spool/p3scan/notify

#
# Parse HTML for web-bugs
#
#  If a person views an HTML email message, not only can the client
#  download pictures automatically, it enables someone viewing
#  the remote log file to confirm the email address is valid,
#  making it "worth" keeping/selling, etc...
#
#  p3scan comes with a separate program p3pmail that can be
#  installed to parse html to prevent this.
#
#  Any other program can be used if it parses to stdout, but there
#  were no others when I wrote p3pmail. :(
#
#  default: do not parse HTML
#
# parsehtml = /usr/bin/p3pmail

#
# PID File
#
#   where to write a pid-file
#
#   default: :localstatedir/run/p3scan/p3scan.pid
#
# pidfile = :localstatedir/run/p3scan/p3scan.pid

#
# Port
#
#   The tcp port on we should listen. If you need a privileged port you
#   need to start p3scan as root (but don't set username to root,
#   that's not necessary, because first after opening the port we will
#   switch to that user).
#
#   default: 8110
#
# port = 8110

#
# Quiet
#
#   Disable reporting of normal operating messages. Only report errors
#   or critical information.
#
#   default: display all less debug info
#
# quiet

#
# Rename Attachments
#
#  If renattach is installed and this option is un-commented, we
#  will execute renattach to rename dangerous attachments.
#  (See README for more information)
#
#  default: none
#
# renattach = /usr/local/bin/renattach

#
# Skip Size
#
#   This option can be used to set the maximum message size (in KBytes) that
#   p3scan will use to determine if it should scan an incoming message. If a
#   message is greater than this size, it will not be scanned.
#
#   NOTE: The use option is NOT RECOMMENDED by the author!
#
#   default: none (NOTE: ClamAV has a default of 10MB)
#
# skipsize =

#
# SMTP Port
#
#   The port we should process outgoing email messages.
#
#   default: 25
#
# smtpport = 25

#
# SMTP size
#
#   This option can be used to set the maximum message size (in KBytes) that
#   p3scan will use to determine if it should scan an smtp submission. If a
#   message is greater than this size, it will not be scanned to help
#   alleviate smtp timeouts.
#
# default: none
#
# smtpsize =

#
# SSL/POP3S messages
#
#   Check for SSL/POP3S protocol on a different port.
#
# default: 995
#
# sslport =

#
# TargetIP, TargetPort
#
#   targetip and targetport are the ip and port to connect -
#   default is 0.0.0.0 (transparent proxy mode) and 8110 respectively
#
#   default: targetport is ignored in transparent proxy mode
#
# targetip = 0.0.0.0
# targetport = 8110

#
# Timeout
#
#   Change the default timeout for sending characters/lines to the
#   client while processing a message.
#
#   WARNING: Increasing this value may cause client timeout errors.
#
#   default: 30 seconds
# timeout = 30

#
# Useurl
#
#   Parse username for destination url vice using iptables redirection.
#
#   To use this you should have your email clients replace the username
#   in the email client username field with "username#destinationurl[:port]"
#   and replace the destination url/port with the url/port of p3scan.
#
# Example:
# From:
# username: laitcg                       host: pop.gmail.com             port: 110
# To:
# username: laitcg#pop.gmail.com[:110]   host: <url of p3scan machine>   port: 8110
#   or (if your pop3 server accepts it)
# username: laitcg@gmail.com             host: <url of p3scan machine>   port: 8110
#
# NOTE: [:110] is optional. You may change the port if for some reason port 110 is
#       not being used.
#
# default: <none>
#
# useurl

# Virusscanner
#
#   Depends on scannertype. Read the section below on the scannertype
#   you're going to use and you do not need to ask what to fill in here.
#
#   default: depending on scannertype:
#     basic   : <no default>
#     bash:   : /path/to/filename
#     avpd    : /var/run/
#     avpd_new: /var/run/
#     trophie : /var/run/trophie
#     sophie  : /var/run/sophie
#     clamd   : tcp/ip connection
#
#
# Sample: scannertype basic using McAfee UVSCAN:
# scanner = /usr/local/uvscan/uvscan
# Sample: scannertype basic using FRISK F-Prot Antivirus:
# scanner = /usr/local/bin/f-prot -archive=5 -ai
# Sample: scannertype basic using ClamAV:
# scanner = /usr/bin/clamdscan --no-summary
# Sample: scannertype clamd using ClamAV in TCPSocket mode:
# scanner = 127.0.0.1:3310
# Sample: scannertype bash using p3scan.sh for testing:
# scanner = /usr/local/sbin/p3scan.sh

#
# Scanner Type
#
#   Select here which type of scanner you want to use.
#
#   Basic:
#
#     This is no longer the default when compiled with clamav support.
#
#     Otherwise, it is the default. The configured executable (set in variable
#     "scanner") will be invoked. You can also specify parameters (we are
#     using /bin/sh).  At the end the path to the mail and a "2>&1" is
#     appended.  The program can tell us if it's a virus returning Scanner
#     Returncode (see below) or exit code 0 means, with all ok, all
#     others are reported to syslog, but mails will be delivered unless
#     justdelete is enabled above. The output is scanned using a regular
#     expression which describes where the virusname can be found
#     (see virusregexp).
#
#     If demime is not set, 'path to mail' is the full filename to the
#     rfc822 message, which you MUST NOT DELETE or MODIFY (except if you know
#     how to modify)! If your scanner can not handle rfc822 messages (e.g.
#     McAfee uvscan) set demime and 'path to mail' is a directory which
#     contains all MIME-Parts splitted into separate files. That files are
#     not needed after scanning, so p3scan deletes them.
#
#     You will find a sample-configuration for McAfee's uvscan
#     (http://www.mcafee.com/) in the below sections.
#
#
#   AVPD:
#
#     AVPD is a frontend to 'Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux'
#     (http://www.kaspersky.com/) , which provides a daemon named
#     'kavdaemon'. Once the daemon has been started we connect to
#     kavdaemons socket and tell what files to scan.  This gives a rapid
#     speed increase since the virus-definitions and other
#     scanner-initialization has only to be done once! Here a result from
#     a speedtest which I've made: Running kavdaemon, quallcomms qpopper
#     and p3scan on an Intel P1 with 133MHz and 64MB RAM a client using
#     Netscape-Mail was able to fetch 500 mails (including POP3- UIDL-
#     setting) in 62 seconds (each mail sized 2kByte)!
#
#     We just need to know in which directory your kavdaemon writes the
#     socket 'AvpCtl' and file 'AvpPid', default is '/var/run', which is
#     ok using AVP-default installation, leave in that case the below
#     variable scanner commented, otherwise set there the path. Parameter
#     viruscode and virusregexp will not be used.
#
#     Actual versions of avpd can't handle rcf822, so set demime (this is
#     not standard, it's possible that Kaspersky Labs includes rfc822
#     checking in further releases).
#
#     Important note about using kavdaemon:
#
#     Ensure that virusdir (:localstatedir/spool/p3scan) is included in AVPs
#     'enabled path list', otherwise the mails will not be scanned, but
#     kavdaemon returns ok (I've found no way to check if the mail has
#     been scanned or not). Mail yourself the eicar.com testvirus (from
#     http://www.eicar.com ) to check it!). The 'enabled path' can be set
#     in /opt/AVP/defUnix.prf in the 'Names' line (add
#     ';*/var/spool/p3scan'). Also check if there is a config file in
#     /root/.AVP/ which has higher precedence (if kavdaemon runs a root,
#     otherwise check that users $HOME/.AVP ).
#     scannertype = avpd
#
#     If you are using version 5, then instead of scannertype = avpd, use
#     scannertype = avpd_new
#
#   TROPHIE:
#
#     Trophie is an OpenSource Anti-Virus Daemon, which uses the
#     virus-scanengine and database from Trend Antivirus. Trophie can be
#     found at http://www.vanja.com/tools/trophie/ . Configuration is very
#     simple, just set scannertype to 'trophie' and it should work. If you
#     don't use trophies standard-config  you have to set scanner to the
#     trophie socket.
#     scannertype = trophie
#
#   SOPHIE:
#
#     Sophie is an OpenSource Anti-Virus Daemon, which uses the
#     libsavi interface from Sophos Antivirus (http://www.sophos.com/).
#     Sophie can be found at http://www.clanfield.info/sophie/
#     (Original home of Sophie http://www.vanja.com/tools/sophie/).
#     Configuration is very simple, just set scannertype to 'sophie' and
#     it should work. If you don't use sophies standard-config
#     you have to set scanner to the sophie socket.

#     Un-comment appropriate options below.
#     Use default scannertype = basic
#
#   Clam Anti-Virus: http://www.clamav.net
#
#     P3Scan now defaults to an internal version of ClamAV when it is available.
#
#     If the scannertype is set to "clamav", or is not set at all (and libclamav
#     is available), then "footer", "scanner", "viruscode", and "virusregexp"
#     need not be set and will actually be ignored if it is set.
#
#     The following info pertains to external versions of ClamAV:
#
#     This program must run as the same user as p3scan is running so that
#     it can access the mail files for scanning. Either compile with the
#     options --with-user=mail --with-group=mail (if p3scan is using the
#     the default user/group of "mail") or change "User" in clamav.conf
#     to the user p3scan is running as. If you get a return code other
#     than a 0 or 1, see the clamav documentation for the reason.
#
#     Un-comment "ScanMail" in clamav.conf/clamd.conf as we are scanning mail
#     files so demime does not need to be set below.
#
#     You should start clamd before starting p3scan.
#
#     Un-comment appropriate options below.
#     Use default scannertype = basic
#
#     If using the tcp/ip mode of clamd, then use scannertype = clamd
#     This will allow using the clamav scanner even when it is not running on
#     the same server as p3scan.
#
#   Bash
#
#     This scanner type allows you to do whatever you want with the
#     variables passed to it and can also alow you to call multiple
#     scanners, etc... See p3scan.sh for an example of all the variables.

#
# SMTP Reject
#
#   This option can be used to change the default SMTP Reject message that is
#   sent to the client in the event a message is rejected due to a virus.
#   The error message will have a prefix of "554".
#
# default: Virus detected! P3scan rejected message!
#
# smtprset =

#
# Subject
#
#   This option can be used to change the default subject line when reporting

#   Where to look for an email-template when a virus notification message
#   has to be sent instead of an infected email. That file has to be exist,
#   otherwise p3scan will send an RFC unconform -ERR and closes the
#   connections.
#
#   The email-template should start after the header with the content-type,
#   and so on. You can use some key words which will be replaced when
#   sending, e.g. %MAILDATE%. See the existing p3scan-en.mail for examples
#   of keywords.
#
#   The following templates are available:
#
#   p3scan-en.mail
#   p3scan-fr.mail
#   p3scan-ge.mail
#   p3scan-it.mail
#   p3scan-pl.mail
#   p3scan-pt-br.mail
#   p3scan-ru.mail
#   p3scan-sp.mail
#
#   default: :sysconfdir/p3scan/p3scan-en.mail
#
# template = :sysconfdir/p3scan/p3scan-en.mail

#
# Username
#
#   The username the daemon should run as. Takes no effect when you
#   start as a non-root user.
#
#   default: mail
#
user = nobody

#
# User Whitelist
#
#   P3Scan will automatically check for p3scan.whitelist (and p3scan.blacklist)
#   per connection. However, if this option is enabled, p3scan will look for
#   p3scan.whitelist.username (and p3scan.blacklist.username) in the directory
#   indicated instead.
#
#   This list can be placed anywhere you specify below. In the event you want to
#   allow the users to have access to their own lists. You can specify "~" and
#   it will be expanded to /home/usesrname/p3scan.whitelist.username and
#   /home/usesrname/p3scan.blacklist.username as described below. "~" must be by
#   itself with no other characters.
#
#   The lists themselves should have an email address per line.
#   For example:
#   :sysconfdir/p3scan/p3scan.blacklist:
#   ebay@ebay.com
#   Department@fbi.gov
#
#   NOTE: The user name will be taken from the USER parameter when the client
#   is logging into a server. Of course you can create sym-links for multiple
#   user names to a single home directories whitelist file.
#
#   default: use global whitelist/blacklist (as in :sysconfdir/p3scan/p3scan.whitelist)
#
# userlist = ~
# userlist = :sysconfdir/p3scan

#
# Scanner Returncode
#
#   Specify the returncode(s) which the scanner returns when the mail is
#   infected. P3Scan does its part (sending the notification and not the
#   infected mail) only when it gets the specified returncode(s).
#   A returncode value of 0 from the scanner is assumed to mean that the
#   message is clean. Any other unspecified value will add warning lines
#   to your logfiles but THE MESSAGE WILL BE DELIVERED!
#
#   Only used from scannertype 'basic'.
#
#   default: 1
#
# Sample: scannertype basic using McAfee UVSCAN:
# viruscode = 13
# Sample: scannertype basic using FRISK F-Prot Antivirus:
# viruscode = 3,8

#
# Virus Directory
#
#   The directory in which infected mails will be stored.  It is also
#   used for temporary storing. Ensure that the above specified user is
#   allowed to write into!
#
#   default: :localstatedir/spool/p3scan
#
# virusdir = :localstatedir/spool/p3scan

#
# Regular Expression for Virusname
#
#   Specify here a regular expression which describes where the name of the
#   virus can be found. If not specified, the first substring is used;
#   specify it appending '/' and the substring number (1-9) at the end.
#   PerlCompatibleRegularExpressions are used, case sensitive and the
#   ungreedy option. Only used by scannertype's 'basic' and 'bash'
#
#   NOTE: If you do not use the basic or bash scanners, you may compile
#   p3scan w/out PCRE support using the --disable-pcre configure option.
#
#   default: <none>
#
# Sample: McAfee UVSCAN
# virusregexp = ^[[:space:]]*Found( the|:)[[:space:]]*(.*)[[:space:]]*(|virus[^a-z.]*)$/2
# Sample: FRISK F-Prot Antivirus
# virusregexp = (?=Infection\:)[[:space:]]*(.*)$
# Sample: ClamAV
# virusregexp = .*: (.*) FOUND
