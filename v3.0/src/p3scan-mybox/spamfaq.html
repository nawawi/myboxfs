BUT PLEASE <b>NOTE</b> because I receive (on the average) over 200 e-mails<b>EVERY</b> day (of which 195 or soare spam) you MUST put the words &quot;Alt.spam&quot; in the subject of thee-mail or there is a <b>VERY</b> goodchance the e-mail will be deleted without being read.&nbsp; I get 10 or 15&quot;No Subject&quot; spams a day.<br><br>My news source is OK, but I sometimes miss items.<br><br>I accept all and any input.&nbsp; I consider myself to be the manager of thisFAQ for the good of everyone, not the absolute &amp; controlling Owner Of TheFAQ.&nbsp; I do not always write in a completely coherent manner.&nbsp; Whatmakes sense to me may not make sense to others.&nbsp; If the community wants somethingadded or deleted, I will do so.&nbsp; I removed any e-mail and last namereferences to someone making a suggestion / addition.&nbsp; This is so thatsomeone doesn't get upset at this FAQ and do something stupid.&nbsp; If youdon't mind having your e-mail in this FAQ (or where it is required), pleasetell me and I will add it back in.<br><br>If you are in the United States and have not yet written to your Senator orHouse of Representatives about how terrible the CAN-SPAM act is, I would askyou to do so.&nbsp; Bottom line is that there are many large corporations andover 22.9 million small businesses on the United States.&nbsp; If you receivedjust one e-mail a year from each of the small businesses (I am not evenincluding large companies) you would receive 63,800 e-mails PER DAY.&nbsp;According to CAN-SPAM you would then be required to opt out of each and everyone of these e-mails, and the company has 10 days to honor your request.&nbsp;Of course this would not stop spammers from changing company names every 10days and just start spamming all over again.&nbsp; I have written a letterexplaining why I think that this act was poorly written, and I would ask you towrite a letter to your representatives also:<br><a href="http://home.digital.net/~gandalf/CAN-SPAM.htm">http://home.digital.net/~gandalf/CAN-SPAM.htm</a><br><a href="http://gandalf.home.digital.net/CAN-SPAM.htm">http://gandalf.home.digital.net/CAN-SPAM.htm</a><br><br>How did this incredibly bad law get passed?&nbsp; This law was written withoutany public hearings, with input from only the marketing industry and InternetService Provider lobbies (guess who loses, You Do).&nbsp; From <ahref="http://www.cauce.org/news/index.shtml">http://www.cauce.org/news/index.shtml</a>:<br>&quot;CAUCE is also disappointed that both the House and Senate versions ofthis law were passed without any public hearings, instead being written andpassed solely through back-room compromises and with the input of the marketingindustry and Internet Service Provider lobbies, but with scant regard for theinterests of America's consumers and business Internet users.&quot;<br><br>Apparently one of the lobbying groups talking to our representatives (for you)is The Center for Democracy and Technology.&nbsp; They were kind enough tospeak for &quot;everybody&quot; in this missive sent to Congress:<br><a href="http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/031015cdt.shtml">http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/031015cdt.shtml</a><br><br>They supported everything the Direct Marketing Association ( <ahref="http://www.the-dma.org/">http://www.the-dma.org/</a> (telemarketers)) andspammers wanted in a bill and more.<br><br>CDT is supported by many different companies:<br><a href="http://www.cdt.org/mission/supporters.shtml">http://www.cdt.org/mission/supporters.shtml</a><br><br>Find Your Senators at <ahref="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm">http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm</a>and find your US Representative: <a href="http://www.house.gov/writerep/">http://www.house.gov/writerep/</a>(Fill in your state and zip, click &quot;Contact My Representative&quot; andyou will be told who your representative is).

Be carefulbefore accusing someone.<br><br>Commands used in this FAQ are UNIX &amp; VMS commands.&nbsp; Sorry if theydon't work for you, you might wish to try looking around at your commands tofind an equivalent command (or I might be able to help out some).&nbsp; Thereare programs for the Macintosh and Windows machines that do the same thing theUNIX commands do, see the above URL's for where to locate this software.<br><br>And no, I am not going to tell you how to post a fake message or fakee-mail.&nbsp; It only took me about 2 days (a few hours a day) to figure itout.&nbsp; It ain't difficult.&nbsp; RTFM (or more appropriately, Read The@&amp;%^@# RFC).<br><br>Every e-mail or post will have a point at which it was injected into theinformation stream.&nbsp; E-mail will have a real computer from which it waspassed along.&nbsp; Likewise a post will have a news server that startedpassing the post.&nbsp; You need to get cooperation of the postmaster at thesites the message passed thru.&nbsp; Then you can get information from the logstelling you what sites the message actually passed thru, and where the message&quot;looked&quot; like it passed thru (but actually didn't).&nbsp; Of courseyou do have to have the cooperation of all the postmasters in a string ofsites...<br><br><a name=item1a>The Easy Way To Get Rid Of spam</a><br>=========================<br><br>Sorry to tell you this but if you received a spam (Unsolicited CommercialE-Mail) there is no &quot;easy&quot; way to get the spam stopped.&nbsp;Generally if you reply (unsubscribe) this confirms that your e-mail address is&quot;live&quot; and just gets your e-mail address sold to otherspammers.&nbsp; Spam has to be dealt with one at a time.&nbsp; Sorry, it isn'teasy to stop the spam.&nbsp; The &quot;Internet&quot; (the collectivenon-profit and profit entities of the network) is trying to fix this problembut it is taking time.&nbsp; The &quot;easiest&quot; way to stop getting spamis to change your e-mail address and only give your e-mail address to peopleyou absolutely trust, and to NEVER allow the e-mail address to be posted to aweb site or posted ANYWHERE on the internet.&nbsp; To see how many times mye-mail address appears on the Internet go to the following link:<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=gandalf%40digital.net">http://www.google.com/search?q=gandalf%40digital.net</a><br><a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/edu/2003/0324ed1.html">http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/edu/2003/0324ed1.html</a>- E-Mail addresses on the web attract the most spam<br><br>It your e-mail address shows up on a search engine, then the spammers can findyour e-mail address also.&nbsp; Be careful about giving your e-mail address tocompanies that purport to be against spam:<br><a href="http://www.gripe2ed.com/scoop/story/2003/5/15/10299/0559">http://www.gripe2ed.com/scoop/story/2003/5/15/10299/0559</a><br><br>There are businesses that make a good living filtering out spam both on apersonal and corporate level.&nbsp; I would suggest that if you really don'twant to deal with spam that you get an e-mail address from one of theseservices (Please note I am not recommending this service, just using it as anexample).&nbsp; Do a search:<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=email+hosting+spam">http://www.google.com/search?q=email+hosting+spam</a><br>And you will come up with companies like:<br><a href="http://www.No-JunkMail.com/">http://www.No-JunkMail.com/</a><br><br>Or if you wish to block it from your personal e-mail account do a search onsomething like:<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=spam+blocking+software">http://www.google.com/search?q=spam+blocking+software</a><br>And you will come up with examples like:<br><a href="http://www.spamulor.net/">http://www.spamulor.net/</a> - Free<br><a href="http://www.spambutcher.com/">http://www.spambutcher.com/</a><br><br>Be aware that no spam blocking software (as of yet) is perfect and you may get&quot;false positives&quot;.&nbsp; An e-mail from a friend may be detected asspam and may get deleted as spam or moved to the spam box.&nbsp; The spam wars:<br><ahref="http://computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/groupware/story/0,10801,75737,00.html">http://computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/groupware/story/0,10801,75737,00.html</a><br><br>Davjohn reminds us that if you are required to give a &quot;legal&quot; e-mailaddress to a company you don't know or trust, go to <a href="http://mail.com/">http://mail.com</a>and set up a free account. There are a hundred-or-so variations available. <ahref="mailto:General.delivery@arcticmail.com">General.delivery@arcticmail.com</a>sounds like a Santa Clause e-mail address.&nbsp; He has 2 addresses there.About once a week he goes in and clicks &quot;empty&quot; and ~flush~ it's allgone.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=item2>Tracing an e-mailmessage</a><br>============================================<br><br>To trace the e-mail you have to look at the header.&nbsp; Most mail readers donot show the header because it contains information that is for computer tocomputer routing.&nbsp; The information you usually see from the header is thesubject, date and the &quot;From&quot; / &quot;Return&quot; address.&nbsp;About the only thing in an e-mail header that can't be faked is the&quot;Received&quot; portion referencing your computer (the last received).<br><br>You will need to take a look at the headers on the message as follows (Thanksto Bob, Dave, Kathy, Michael, Piers, Russ, Simon, Chalmers and others) :<br><b>Claris E-Mailer</b> - under Mailselect Show Long Headers.<br><b>Eudora (before ver. 3)</b> - SelectTools , Options... , then Fonts &amp; Display then Show all headers<br><b>Eudora (ver. 3.x, 4.x IBM or Macintosh)</b> - Press the BLAH button on the incoming mail message<br><b>Eudora V5.1</b>:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Double-click on the email subject linein the current mailbox. This displays the same message with a fuller version ofthe header, which will be enough for some ISPs but not all, and also shows anextra Toolbox which contains the BlahBlahBlah button<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Click on the BlahBlahBlah button<br><b>For Mac Eudora 4.x</b>, hitting thefollowing will cause Eudora to alter its default setting so that BLAH will beautomatically selected for all new email received after this switch is set:<br>&lt;x-eudora-setting:123=y&gt; When checked, Eudora will show all the headersfrom messages, not just an abbreviated set.<br><b>Hotmail </b>- How to set show themail headers in hotmail:<br>1.&nbsp; After you login, just to the right of the tabs, select Options<br>2.&nbsp; Under Additional Options, select Mail Display Settings<br>3.&nbsp; In the Message Headers section, click the Advanced button<br><b>JUNO</b> - Click on the word&quot;OPTIONS&quot; in the MENU BAR.<br>On This menu, click on &quot;E-Mail Options (ctrl-E)&quot;<br>This will get you a Dialog Box:<br>In the &quot;Show message headers&quot; part, you need to have the&quot;Full&quot; button marked in order to show full message headings.<br><b>KMAIL (KDE Mail Client)</b> - Bryantells us To display all headers in kmail(KDE mail client), go to 'view' andclick 'all headers'.<br><b>Lotus Notes R4 and R5</b>:<br>1) Examine the fields in the document.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on File --&gt; Document Properties<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on fields tab (square rule)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Scroll down to the &quot;received&quot; fields - there should beone for each &quot;received&quot; header added.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy and paste these into a file.<br>2) Export the headers from the document<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; *important*&nbsp; You need to be in the inbox folder in Notes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the document.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on File --&gt; Export<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter a temporary file name, ensure File type is &quot;StructuredText&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Export options, click on &quot;selected documents&quot;,click OK.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The generated file contains all the headers on the message alongwith the message body.<br><b>Lotus Notes R6:</b> Open the mail,View/ Show /Page Source and the OpenNTF mailtemplate has an action to forwardthe full header (to yourself, or to support for instance). &nbsp;You may wantto copy that, or use the template.<br><b>MS Outlook</b> - Double click on theemail in your inbox. This will bring the message into a window. Click on View -Options.&nbsp; You can also open a message then chooseFile....Properties....Details.<br><b>Microsoft Outlook 2000</b> - Fromthe Menu Bar select &quot;View&quot; and then &quot;Options&quot; from thatmenu.<br>This displays a dialogue box called &quot;Message Options&quot;.<br>The largest and last text box is called &quot;Internet headers:&quot;<br>Scroll through this to read all the details.<br>To save a copy, highlight all the content, and copy it to the clipboard bypressing &lt;Ctrl C&gt; (thats both those keys at the same time), then go intowhatever word processor or email program you wish and press &lt;Ctrl V&gt; topaste the text onto that page.<br><br>Because Microsoft Outlook has many security flaws, the below instructions mayexpose your computer to risks.&nbsp; See:<br><a href="http://www.the-foxhole.org/Disabling_IE_Security_Flaws.htm">http://www.the-foxhole.org/Disabling_IE_Security_Flaws.htm</a><br><b>MS Outlook Express</b> - Alt-Enter,or Alt-F then R.<br><b>MS Outlook Express</b> - MoreDetailed:<br>&nbsp; To look for, copy and send headers In Outlook Express <br>&nbsp; 1- Press CTRL F3<br>&nbsp; 2- Press CTRL A <br>&nbsp; 3- Press CTRL C<br>&nbsp; 4- Press Alt F4.

This will show the full headers for the particular message, but willnot add them to any reply or forward. You need to cut/paste the message intothe reply/forward to send these headers.<br><br>Richard tells us with Nettamer, a MS DOS based email and USENET group readeryou must save the message as an ASCII file, then the full header will bedisplayed when you open the saved file with your favorite ASCII editor.<br><br>At this point if you are &quot;pushing the envelope&quot;

connected (host1).<br><br>Looking at the below we see 6 received lines.&nbsp; Received lines are likelinks in a chain.&nbsp; The message is passed from one computer to the next withno breaks in the chain.&nbsp; The received lines indicate that it ended up atdigital.net (my computer) from mail.bestnetpc.com.&nbsp; It was received atmail.bestnetpc.com from unknown (HELO paul-s.-aiello)([205.160.183.123]).&nbsp; The last three lines suggests that it was receivedat in2.|bm.net from mh.tomsurl|.com and from reb50.rs41|1date.net.&nbsp; Sincenone of these computers are in the first two received lines then we can ignorethese lines and every received entry after this line (this UCE had 4 or 5 morefaked Received lines in it that were deleted for this example).&nbsp; We alsoknow that these lines are faked because no domain name has a &quot;|&quot;character in the name.&nbsp; Domain names only have alphabetic or numericcharacters in the name.<br><br>Do not get confused by the &quot;Received: from unknown&quot;

Usuallythe ISP will require you to get the local police involved (a warrant of sometype) to force the ISP to give you that information. &nbsp;Even given that youknow the account the e-mail originated from, a forger can find out thatperson's account / password and log in as them, they can gain access to thatcomputer while the person who owns that computer is away from the computer orthey could install a back door program that allows them to control thatperson's computer remotely.&nbsp; If this were to happen then the forger couldsend the e-mail and nobody would know who *specifically* sent the e-mail.<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=item2b>MAILING LIST messages</a><br>========================================<br><br>Stephanie kindly defines MAILING LIST versus LISTSERVER :<br><br>A MAILING LIST is a type of email distribution in which email is sent to afixed site which holds a list of email recipients and mail is distributed tothose recipients automatically (or through a moderator).<br><br>A LISTSERVER is a software program designed to manage one or more mailinglists.&nbsp; One of the more popular packages is named&quot;LISTSERV&quot;.&nbsp; Besides Listserv, other popular packages includeListproc which is a Unix Listserv clone (Listservs originated on BITNET),Majordomo and Mailserve.&nbsp; Most importantly -- not all mailing lists run onlistservers, there are many mailing lists that are manually managed.<br><br>You may hear of mailing lists being referred to as many things, some strange,some which on the surface make sense, like &quot;email discussiongroups&quot;.&nbsp; But this isn't accurate either, since not all mailing listsare set up for discussion.<br><br>Istvan suggests &quot;Majordomo software is remarkably funny aboutheaders.&nbsp; It does not like headers which contain anything odd. Allmessages the software receives which do not conform to its rigorous standardsare simply forwarded to the list moderator.&nbsp; It turns out this feature iseffective at stopping between 80 and 90% of spam actually getting to thelist.&quot;<br><br>Kirk tells us that you can set majordomo up so that new subscribers have toreply to a subscribe request, thus verifying the address is legit.&nbsp;Additionally the lists can be configured so that only subscribers canpost.&nbsp; And finally you can put filters on content.&nbsp; I've got the listI manage configured to reject multipart email and email which contains html.<br><br>Jeff adds that this would be the closed+confirm option in the configurationfile so that only subscribers can post. Also, to prevent multipart or HTML thiswould be the taboo_headers configuration.<br><br>Richard mentions &quot;Listserv can be configured to restrict non-members fromsending to a list and can restrict spam based on the headers similar toMajordomo.&nbsp; I've used both of these features successfully.&nbsp; You canread more about Listserv capabilities, if you are interested, at:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lsoft.com/listserv.stm">http://www.lsoft.com/listserv.stm</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lsoft.com/spamorama.html#FILTER">http://www.lsoft.com/spamorama.html- FILTER</a> (info on its spam filter)<br>I suspect that Listserv's spam filter may be better than Majordomo's (but I'venot managed any Majordomo lists).&quot;<br><br>Jeff adds that having ran a majordomo list for almost 4 years, I find majordomoto be every bit as good.&nbsp; I should, however, qualify that; the listownerneeds to have his/her clueons in good working order.&nbsp; Simply put, nolistowner in their right mind should leave their majordomo lists set toanything other than closed+confirm.&nbsp; Alas, there are listowners who willleave their lists wide open.&nbsp; I've also seen others knock themselves deadcreating their own filters just so a listmember can post to the list from aweb-based e-mail account while on vacation.&nbsp; I usually tell anyone in sucha situation to subscribe to the list from whatever free e-mail account theyplan to use.&nbsp; IMO, I cannot justify compromising list security for suchreasons.&nbsp; Lists should be closed+confirm...plain and simple.<br><br>Example Header appears below:<br>Received: from dir.bham.ac.uk (dir.bham.ac.uk [147.188.128.25]) by gol1.gol.com(8.7.5/8.6.9) with SMTP id GAA27292 for &lt;XXXX@gol.com&gt;; Sun, 5 May 199606:31:15 +0900 (JST)<br>Received: from bham.ac.uk by dir.bham.ac.uk with SMTP (PP) using DNS&nbsp; id&lt;26706-38@dir.bham.ac.uk&gt;; Sat, 4 May 1996 20:56:49 +0100<br>Received: from emout09.mail.aol.com (actually emout09.mx.aol.com) bybham.ac.uk&nbsp; with SMTP (PP); Sat, 4 May 1996 21:13:03 +0100<br>Received: by emout09.mail.aol.com (8.6.12/8.6.12) id PAA29156; Sat, 4 May 199615:35:53 -0400<br>Date: Sat, 4 May 1996 15:35:53 -0400<br>From: Jeanchev@aol.com<br>Message-ID: &lt;960504153553_287142426@emout09.mail.aol.com&gt;<br>Subject: CRaZy Complimentary Offer........<br><br>This is a post from Kevin Lipsitz for his &quot;===&gt;&gt; FREE 1 yr.

Of course the spammers mentality is&quot;if it is free it is for me to abuse&quot;.&nbsp; If the spammer reallyannoyed you then you might wish to dig and get every account possibledeleted.&nbsp; What you need to do is actually go to the WWW page that theyadvertise, look at the page and usually the page will redirect you to anothersite (or possibly redirect 2 or 3 times).&nbsp; Send a complaint to these sites(with the original spam).&nbsp; It is important to explain to the site you arecomplaining to how you got to their site so that they don't ignore you.<br><br>In Netscape and Explorer there is an option to &quot;view source&quot;.&nbsp;This will pop up a page with all of the http source from the page.&nbsp; Thispage will have all of the &quot;links&quot; to the next site.<br><br>If you look at the http source and it is unreadable (and sez&quot;Haywyre&quot;), take a look at :<br><a href="http://www.netdemon.net/haywyre/">http://www.netdemon.net/haywyre/</a><br><br>There are spammers out there that actually have a clue.&nbsp; They use open WebProxies to reroute their web page to another location.&nbsp; When you do a pingof a web site, the ping is of the open web proxy.&nbsp; The open web proxy thenredirects you when it gets the request for the web page.&nbsp;

The spammer then redirects the information to their&quot;real&quot; site.<br><br><a href="http://www.spamsites.org/decode.html">http://www.spamsites.org/decode.html</a>tells us that to decode the Java script and complain to the people that areactually hosting the spammers, set up a bookmark called &quot;DecodeJavascript&quot;

Joe Spam might have his own domain (since they _used_ to befree) inside of which they are the postmaster. This is terrifyingly common withnet.twits (kooks, etc.) but seems rare for spam. A quick note that if thespammer is the admin contact in WhoIs, notifying the postmaster will surelygenerate laughs on their end.<br><br>In the letter to the postmaster, you might wish to mention Joel's very good FAQabout advertising on the Internet :<br><ahref="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/wais/html/na-dir/usenet/advertising/how-to/part1.html">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/wais/html/na-dir/usenet/advertising/how-to/part1.html</a><br><ahref="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/usenet/advertising/how-to/part1/faq.html">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/usenet/advertising/how-to/part1/faq.html</a><br><br>One company that was suckered in by a bulk e-mail company received 35 responsesto the addresses in the body of the message, and 100% of them were negative.Additionally the ISP that hosted them received 15 complaints asking for them toterminate their service.

It is best not to be such a pain that the Geeksfind an intense interest in you. They are almost certainly smarter than you, atthe very least they are smarter in the ways that the Internet works. The worstthing for you, however, is that they usually have no life and can easily makeyou &quot;their life&quot;.<br><br><br><a name=item8d>How *did* I get this unsolicited e-mail anyway?</a><br>==================================================<br>Unfortunately just posting a message to a news group can get unsolicitede-mail. Some spammers &quot;harvest&quot; e-mail addresses by stripping e-mailreturn addresses out of messages people post. Try posting to alt.test a fewtimes. You will get not only a few autoresponder messages (that is how it is*supposed* to work) but also a few unsolicited pieces of e-mail. The solutionto this is to &quot;mung&quot; your address when you post by adding in extracharacters (like &quot;Spam&quot;) in your return address. You then put in yoursignature something like &quot;Remove the word Spam from my e-mail to contactme&quot;.

That onlyconfirms your e-mail as &quot;real&quot; and gets your e-mail address sold toothers. More spam for you.<br><br>Another way to get e-mail is to have a World Wide Web page. Some spammers juststart a web spider (a piece of software that just traverses World Wide Webpages and collects information) going and collect e-mail that way. To preventyour e-mail from being harvested, you can &quot;mung&quot; your web e-mail. <br><br>Yet another way for spammers to verify your address is real is to have multipleunique pages to their site so that when you click on the URL they provide, theyknow that you (and only you) got that URL. See:<br><a href="http://cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/01/14/email.privacy.idg/index.html">http://cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/01/14/email.privacy.idg/index.html</a><br><br>Greg tells us of yet another clever trick. The spammer imbeds a unique image(Web Bug) in a spam e-mail so that just the act of opening the e-mail tells thespammer that your address is &quot;live&quot;:<br>imgsrc=&quot;http://209.73.247.130/cgi-bin/loadbalance/load.cgi?servers=clusters_1-9&amp; image=39E218DC0DE2341934ED231E203E382D2193A7B975B23CA8EA-3.jpeg&quot;border=0<br><br>I have seen yet another trick that spammers use, they make the URL a webbug.&nbsp; When you have a link likehttp://NAIOKWDVDISY.adwarebde.com/?id=02025 the &quot;name&quot; of the website NAIOKWDVDISY can uniquely identify what e-mail address that spam was sentto.&nbsp; Just doing a NSLookup of the name will point out the e-mail addressof the person that the spam was sent to thus identifying a &quot;live&quot;person.<br><br>Pierre suggests that when putting a mailto URL in a web page, precede andfollow it with &quot;%20&quot;. When someone clicks on it, it will merely putspaces, which will be ignored, around the address, but when a spammer harveststhe address, it will have a %20 in it, which will render it undeliverable.<br><br>A suggestion of some nasty little HTML items to have in your WWW page(invisible, of course) are :<br>&lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:root@[127.0.0.1]&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br>or if your server allows &quot;server-side includes&quot; (and .shtml) :<br>a&lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:abuse@!--#echo var=&quot;REMOTE_ADDR&quot;--&quot;anti spambot&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br><br>Also you might include a mail to news gateway like the following so that theSpam is posted to Usenet :<br>See <a href="https://ssl.dizum.com/help/mail2news.html">https://ssl.dizum.com/help/mail2news.html</a>for mail to news gateways.<br>A <a href="mailto:HREF=">HREF=&quot;mailto:news.admin.net-abuse.email@myriad.alias.net&quot;/a</a><br>Or<br>A <a href="mailto:HREF=">HREF=&quot;mailto:news.admin.net-abuse.misc@myriad.alias.net&quot;/a</a><br>Or<br>A <a href="mailto:HREF=">HREF=&quot;mailto:news.admin.net-abuse.usenet@myriad.alias.net&quot;/a</a><br>Note : You should note on your World Wide Web page that these links should*not* be followed by Lynx users, as they will see them no matter how you choosenot to display them on a graphical interface.

If you try anything against the spammers, please * donot * put yourself in risk of breaking the law. It only makes them happy if youget in trouble because you were trying to get back at them.<br><br>The reason why spammers use &quot;throwaway&quot; accounts is because they knowthe e-mail account will be deleted. They usually provide either another e-mailaddress or a name / phone number or postal address so that prospective&quot;customers&quot; can be contacted. Be sure to complain to the postmasterof all e-mail names provided to make sure that this route is inhibited.<br><br>There are sites dedicated to revenge, just search in Google.&nbsp; Jeffmentions that some people cross enter 800 numbers, phone numbers and addressesof spammers onto other spammers' sites.&nbsp; He says the least we can do isintroduce like minded individuals to each other. Just being neighborly. ;-)<br><br>You can ask the Attorney General of a state whether or not that business islicensed in that state, and who runs the business.
