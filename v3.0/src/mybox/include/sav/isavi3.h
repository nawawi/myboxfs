      /* Description:
            Sweep a buffer for viruses. 

         Parameters:
            pBuffName      The name of the buffer to sweep.
            buffSize       The size in bytes of the buffer to sweep.
            pBuff          Pointer to the buffer to sweep.
            ResultsIID     Identifies the type of the results to be returned.
                           At present this must be SOPHOS_IID_ENUM_SWEEPRESULTS.
            ppResults      A pointer to a pointer to an IEnumSweepResults object which
                           will be created by this function. The object can be used
                           by the caller to enumerate any viruses found in the buffer.
                           If there are no viruses, an enumerator containing zero items
                           is returned. When the caller has finished with the object, 
                           it must call Release() on the object.
                           This parameter may be supplied as NULL, in which case no sweep
                           results object is created.
     
         Return value:
            Note that there are multiple success codes so it is recommended that callers
            use the SUCCEEDED() macro to test for successful completion of this function.
            
            Success codes:
            SOPHOS_S_OK    The buffer was successfully swept and contained no viruses.
            SOPHOS_SAVI_ERROR_VIRUSPRESENT
                           The buffer was successfully swept and contained one or more viruses.
            SOPHOS_SAVI_ERROR_OLD_VIRUS_DATA
                           The buffer was successfully swept but the internal virus data is 
                           beyond its useful life. Sophos recommends that the virus engine is
