Here the libraries linkage I use :

Squid 2.5 configuration :
---------------------

To integrate squidclamav to your squid cache just edit the squid.conf
file and set the following:

on ACL definition you should have declared:

	acl localhost src 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255
	acl to_localhost dst 127.0.0.0/8

on http_acces definition you should declared the follwing :

	http_access deny to_localhost
	http_access allow localhost
	url_rewrite_access deny localhost

and on the redirect section the following:

	url_rewrite_program /usr/local/squidclamav/bin/squidclamav
	url_rewrite_children 15

If you have huge access and enough memory set the url_rewrite_children to
upper value.
