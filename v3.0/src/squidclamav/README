README file for SquidClamav Version 2.0

SquidClamav - A Clamav Antivirus Redirector for Squid -
		http://www.samse.fr/GPL/squidclamav/


Please see INSTALL file file for installation instructions

Configuration :
---------------

By default, the configuration file is located at:

  /usr/local/squidclamv/etc/squidclamav.conf

You need to create this file from scratch with the aids of
the following instructions:

Squidclamav Patterns:

The syntax of lines in the squidclamav.conf file are of the form:

	regex|regexi pattern
or
	abort|aborti pattern
or
	content|contenti pattern
or
	redirect cgi_url_redirection

Full regex matching is made available by the use of the GNU Regex libary.
It also supports pattern buffers.

Let's say you want to check against the ClamAv antivirus files with
case insensitive extension .exe, .com and .zip. Then here are the line
you may include:

	regexi  ^.*\.exe$
	regexi  ^.*\.com$
	regexi  ^.*\.zip$

Now let's say you want don't want to check image and HTML files, then you
should include the following lines in the configuration file:

	aborti ^.*\..gif$
	aborti ^.*\..png$
	aborti ^.*\..jpg$
	abort ^.*\..html$
	abort ^.*\..htm$

If you don't want to check directory listing or default index.html add
the following line :

	abort ^.*\/$

You may want to allow virus scanning based on content type, for example
for all 'application/*' file:

	content ^application\/.*$

will scan all files with this content-type.

Here is the configuration I use:

	abort ^.*\/cgi-bin\/.*$
	abort ^.*\.gz$
	abort ^.*\.pdf$
	abort ^.*\.js$
	abort ^.*\.html$
	abort ^.*\.css$
	abort ^.*\.xml$
	abort ^.*\.xsl$
	content ^.*application\/.*$

When a virus is found the squidclamav program should redirect the request
to a CGI program. You must specify the URL to this CGI with the redirect
directive as follow:

	redirect http://proxy.domain.com/cgi-bin/clwarn.cgi

Squidclamav will pass to this CGI the following parameters:

	url=ORIGNAL_HTTP_REQUEST
	virus=NAME_OF_THE_VIRUS
	source=DOWNLOADER_IP_ADDRESS
	user=DOWNLOADER_IDENT

Virus scanning can be stop on large files by configuring clamd (see clamd.conf).

You can overwrite the URL/port to your Squid proxy as follow :

	proxy http://127.0.0.1:3128

This is the default value. To disable the use of proxy download in special
case, set this option to 'none'. Note that you should always use localhost
interface to prevent loop. See section Squid ACL in INSTALL file.

The log file can be set with:

	logfile /var/log/squidclamav.log

Default is /usr/local/squidclamav/logs/squidclamav.log

If you need to change the path to the configuration file edit
file path.h change the default value and recompile+reinstall
or give it at squid.conf call as program first parameter.

You can specify a timeout on libcurl connection when squidclam
try to download the file by using the 'timeout' configuration
option.

Some http servers send malformed header (especially for ads) and
libcurl is not able to return valid content-type or other header
information. I you want to force virus scan of these URL set the
'force' option to 1.

To show time statistics of URL processing you must set the 'stat' option
to 1.

Configuring connection Clamd :
-----------------------------

You have 3 configuration option to set the connection to clamd daemon.

If you use unix local socket, just set clamd_local to the socket path
as follow:

	clamd_local /tmp/clamd

If you use TCP socket set the clamd_ip and clamd_port as follow:

	clamd_ip 192.168.1.5
	clamd_port 3310

DO NOT set the clamd_local if you want to use TCP socket !!!
