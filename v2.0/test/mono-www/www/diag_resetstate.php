                      Resetting the state tables will remove all entries from 
                      the corresponding tables. This means that all open connections 
                      will be broken and will have to be re-established. This 
                      may be necessary after making substantial changes to the 
                      firewall and/or NAT rules, especially if there are IP protocol 
                      mappings (e.g. for PPTP or IPv6) with open connections.<br>
