serial
------

 - Command: serial [`--unit=unit'] [`--port=port'] [`--speed=speed']
          [`--word=word'] [`--parity=parity'] [`--stop=stop']
          [`--device=dev']
     Initialize a serial device. UNIT is a number in the range 0-3
     specifying which serial port to use; default is 0, that corresponds
     the port often called COM1. PORT is the I/O port where the UART is
     to be found; if specified it takes precedence over UNIT.  SPEED is
     the transmission speed; default is 9600. WORD and STOP are the
     number of data bits and stop bits. Data bits must be in the range
     5-8 and stop bits are 1 or 2. Default is 8 data bits and one stop
     bit. PARITY is one of `no', `odd', `even' and defaults to `no'.
     The option `--device' can only be used in the grub shell and is
     used to specify the tty device to be used in the host operating
     system (*note Invoking the grub shell::).

     The serial port is not used as a communication channel unless the
     `terminal' command is used (*note terminal::).

     This command is only available if GRUB is compiled with serial
     support. See also *Note Serial terminal::.
