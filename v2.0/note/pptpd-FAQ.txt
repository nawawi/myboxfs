2.0 Browsing support

2.1 How does Windows know which IP address belongs to machine names listed in
    the Network Neighborhood?

	This mapping can be found from a WINS server, or from the LMHOSTS
	file, or both.  If you have both, Windows looks to the WINS server
	first, and if it doesn't find the answer there, will look in the
	LMHOSTS file. 
	If you enable the "Use DNS for NetBIOS name resolution" option
	in the Network control panel, Windows will also look to the HOSTS
	file and a DNS server to map NetBIOS (Windows) machine names to
	IP addresses.  The order of precedence is:

	1) Check to see if it is the local machine name.
	2) Check its cache of remote names. Any name that is resolved is
	   placed in a cache where it will remain for 10 minutes.
	3) Try the WINS Server.
	4) Try broadcasting.
	5) Check the LMHOSTS file, if the system is configured to use 
	   the LMHOSTS file.
	6) Try the HOSTS file, if so configured.
	7) Try a DNS server, if so configured.

	The HOSTS and LMHOSTS files are in c:\windows in Win9x, and in
	c:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc in WinNT and Win2000.
	The HOSTS and LMHOSTS basic format is <IP> <NAME>.  For example:
		192.168.1.1	gateway	
		192.168.1.2	doorway
	When the name resolution is properly configured, you can access
	"\\machinename\sharename".  

	Name resolution and browsing are two different things, so you can
	have name resolution working while browsing does not work (i.e. you
	can access "\\machinename\sharename" but machinename doesn't show up
	in the Network Neighborhood), or you can have browsing working
	while name resolution does not work (i.e. machinename shows up in
	Network Neighborhood, but when you double-click it you get an error
	message that says windows cannot find the machine.)

2.2 Will Network Neighborhood browsing work without a WINS server?

	Yes.  If you have pptpd and samba running on the same machine, and
	samba is accessible to the VPN machines, then your VPN machines will
	be able to get the browse list from the samba machine.
	To enable browsing support on the Samba server, set the following
	option in /etc/smb.conf:
		browse list = yes
	When browse lists are working properly you can see the list of machines
	in the file /var/lock/samba/browse.dat on the samba server.

2.3 What needs to be done to enable WINS support?

	When using a WINS server, all client machines on the network must be
	configured to use the WINS server, because the WINS server will
	only know about machines that are configured with the WINS server
	address.

	For machines on the local network, the WINS server configuration
	is set in the Network control panel, under the TCP/IP properties.

	For VPN machines, the WINS server address can be either manually
	configured in the Properties for the Dial-up Networking connection,
	under the TCP/IP Settings button, or automatically configured by
	the server by adding the line
		ms-wins 192.168.1.1
	to your /etc/ppp/options.pptp file (where the 192.168.1.1 must be
	the address of your WINS server.)

	Samba makes a decent WINS server.  To enable WINS support in Samba,
	set the following option in /etc/smb.conf:
		wins support = yes

2.4 Why wouldn't I want to use an LMHOSTS file for windows name resolution?

	Because you have to properly maintain the list of machine names
	and IP addresses in an LMHOSTS file on each and every machine on
	your network, and on all of the VPN client machines.  This makes
	maintenance more difficult.

2.5 Why would I want to use an LMHOSTS file for windows name resolution?
2.6 Why wouldn't I sant to use a WINS server?

	The answer is the same for both of these questions:
	Name resolution through the LMHOSTS file is faster than going
	through a WINS server.  Much faster, if your WINS server is on
	a slow network link.

2.7 Why would I want to use a WINS server?

	When a WINS server is properly set up, and all machines on your
	network are using the WINS server, then there is no maintenence
	of machine names and IP addresses required -- it is all automatically
	taken care of by the WINS server. 

2.8 What happens if I have my system configured with both WINS and LMHOSTS?

	Per Microsoft, the system will first check with the WINS server,
	and then look in the LMHOSTS file (backwards from the order used
	with DNS lookups).  This means the LMHOSTS file would only be used
	as a backup if it can't find the answer on the WINS server.
	As a result, if you have WINS configured the name resolution will
	always first go to the WINS server, which may significantly slow
	down the name resolution process if your WINS server is on a slow
	network link.

	For more details, see:
	  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q119/4/93.asp

2.9 I swear I have everything configured properly, but browsing still does
    not work!  What could be wrong?

	It could just be a matter of patience.  Network Neighborhood takes
	a little time after the network connection is established before it
	will allow browsing.  If you wait 30 to 60 seconds after connecting
	the VPN before you try to browse Network Neighborhood, you might
	have better success.
	Another trick is to access a share on the samba machine first, and
	then browse the Network Neighborhood.
	Also, remember that generating browse lists may take up to 15 minutes,
	so it could be up to 15 minutes after starting, or restarting,
	samba for the browse list to show all machines on the network.

3.0 OpenBSD related items

3.1 I'm using OpenBSD as a PPTP client, and get LCP messages timing out,
    what might be the problem?

	It could be that the OpenBSD kernel GRE device is swallowing all
	of the GRE packets, and not allowing the PPTP client to get the GRE
	packets.  Try rebuilding the kernel with the GRE device disabled.

	i.e. comment out the "pseudo-device gre 1" line in the 
	kernel configuration file.

3.2 How do I get PoPToP to work with FreeBSD's version of PPP?

	Configure PoPToP using the command:
		./configure --with-bsdppp

3.3 Where can I find more information?

	Read the FreeBSD PPTP HOWTO at:
	  http://heyer.supranet.net/pptp/

4.0 Uncategorized

4.1 What ports are required for ipchains?

	pptpd uses TCP port 1723 for the control connection, and protocol 47
	for the data connection.  Note that the latter is a PROTOCOL,
	not a port.

	To open these using ipchains:

	ipchains -A input -p TCP -d 0.0.0.0/0 1723 -j ACCEPT
	ipchains -A input -p 47 -j ACCEPT

	ipchains -A output -p TCP -s 0.0.0.0/0 1723 -j ACCEPT
	ipchains -A output -p 47 -j ACCEPT

	You can see PPTP traffic using the command:
	    tcpdump -i eth0 -n proto 47 or port 1723
	where eth0 is the network interface on which the VPN connection
	is coming in.  You should set protocol 47 traffic going in and out,
	and protocol 6, port 1723 traffic going in and out.  If not, then
	check your firewalls.

	Also, you must enable packet forwarding in the kernel, and allow
	packet forwarding between the pptp network and the local network.
	If your pptpd network address is 192.168.2.0/24 and your local
	network is 192.168.1.0/24, then you would do this with the following
	commands
	    ipchains -P forward DENY
	    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	    ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 192.168.2.0/24 -j ACCEPT
	    ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.2.0/24 -d 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT

	If both networks are the same range the above two rules would be the 
	same as each other, so you would only need to list one of them.

4.2 How can I assign IP addresses based on user names?

	Configure PoPToP with the command:
		./configure --with-pppd-ip-alloc

	Then BUILD and INSTALL PoPToP as usual.  List the IP addresses as
	the last parameter on each chap-secrets line.  For example:

		tom	*	toms-pw		192.168.1.40
		dick	*	dicks-pw	192.168.1.41
		harry	*	harrys-pw	192.168.1.42

	Will give tom the IP 192.168.1.40, dick .41, and harry .42.

4.3 How can I use /etc/smbpasswd for chap authentication?

	There is a patch available for this which was posted to
	the pptp-server mailing list a while back:

	http://lists.schulte.org/pipermail/pptp-server/2000-April/002190.html

	Apply this patch to the pppd program, rebuild, and then put
	&/etc/smbpasswd in the chap-secrets file where you would normally
	put the plain text password string.

4.4 Can I force incoming connections to use encryption?

	Not out of the box, but there a pppd patch available from:
	    http://smop.de
	Apply this patch to pppd-2.3.11 after applying the mppe patches,
	and then rebuild and reinstall that package.
	To enable the feature, add the options "require-mppe" and
	"require-mppe-stateless" to your /etc/ppp/options.pptp file.

4.5 Can I force incoming connections to only use 128-bit encryption?

	Yes, I have received 2 confirmations that the following will work:

	Apply the patch from http://smop.de (see question
	4.4, above) which allows you to force encryption, and then list only
	the mppe-128 option in the pppd configuration file.
	Then your /etc/ppp/options.pptp file would contain:
		+chap
		+chapms
		+chapms-v2
		mppe-128
		mppe-stateless
		require-mppe
		require-mppe-stateless
	In particular, note the mppe-40 option is NOT listed.
	As a result, if 128-bit encryption is not used, pptpd will disconnect.

7.0 Troubleshooting    

-------------------    


7.1 Setting debug for PoPTop    



If you want to enable debugging follow these steps:    

1. Edit the /etc/syslog.conf file and add the line:    

	daemon.*;local2.*	/var/log/pptpd.log    


2. Restart the syslog daemon:    

	[/etc/rc.d/init.d/syslogd restart]    


3. Make sure the options file you are using (i.e. /etc/ppp/options) has the following:    


	debug    


Setting the debug option here affects all PPP and PPTP connections.    


4. Edit the /etc/pptpd.conf file to contain the following:    


	debug    



pptpd errors and messages should now start showing up in /var/log/pptpd.log    




7.2 Client side errors:    


Windows Client 95/98    


7.2.1. Error 629: You have disconnected from the computer you dialed.....    


	Possible causes:    

	- pptpd daemon not running    
	- pptpctrl not setup properly in /etc/inetd.conf    
	- Windows networking is in a confused state
	  (if the message comes immediately after you press "connect"
	   with no delay, then it probably is because your Windows client
	   is confused.  Reboot the client machine and try again.)

	Possible solutions:    

	- run the pptpd daemon [pptpd -d]    
	- setup pptpctrl per README.inetd instructions    
	- don't forget the #1 debugging tool for Windows:
	    reboot your Windows machine and try it again


7.2.2. Error 645: The microsoft Dial-up adapter is in use or not responding properly.    


	Possible causes:    

	- VPN software not setup correctly by OEM Manufacturer.    
	  The usual cause of this error is not having 2 dial-up networking
	  adapters installed in the Network Control Panel.  When you are
	  making a VPN connection through a modem you need 1 dial-up adapter
	  for the modem connection, and a second dial-up adapter for the VPN.

	Possible solutions:    

	- Go to the Network Control Panel and install a second Dial-Up Adapter.

	or

	- Go to the Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel, "Windows Setup"
	  tab, Communications component, and remove Virtual Private Networking
	  support.  Then reboot your computer, go back to the same tab, and
	  reinstall Virtual Private Networking support.

	Also be sure to install the latest updates to VPN from Microsoft.


7.2.3. Error 650: The Remote Access server is not responding.      


	Possible causes:    

	- There is a problem with packets getting through    


	Possible solutions:    

	- Check firewalls between you and server.      

	Make sure all can pass protocol 47 (GRE) and tcp port 1723.    


7.2.4. Error 691: Access denied because username and/or password is invalid on the domain. 	    


	Possible causes: 	    

	- check /etc/ppp/chap-secrets file for existence/correcteness      


	Possible solutions:    

- Edit the /etc/ppp/chap-secrets file on the server to include the username and password.  Possibly  use     
DOMAINNAME\\username for windows clients.  The message log may contain more hints about what is  expected.  
   


7.2.4.5  Error 720: Dial-Up Networking could not negotiate a compatible set
	of network protocols you specified in the Server Type settings.

	Possible causes:

	- Your pppd options file is empty, or doesn't have the proper options
	  to establish the connection.  Make sure the pppd options file
	  referred to in /etc/pptpd.conf is correct.
		option /etc/ppp/options.pptp
	  Note: the default value for this parameter is /etc/ppp/options

	- Make sure you have the latest Dial-Up networking updates installed
	  on your Windows machine.
	  
7.2.5. Error 742: The remote server does not support encryption.      


	Possible causes:    

	- ppp_mppe module not loaded    


	Possible solutions:    

	[insmod ppp_mppe]     

	or    

	include 'alias ppp-compress-18 ppp_mppe' in the /etc/conf.modules file    

	    

7.2.6. Error 751: The remote computer refused the connection.....    


	Possible causes:    

	- pptpd daemon not running    

	- pptpctrl not setup properly in /etc/inetd.conf    


	Possible solutions:    

	- run the pptpd daemon [pptpd -d]    

	- setup pptpctrl per README.inetd instructions    

7.2.7.	Can see machines from the local network in Network Neighborhood, but
	get "\\machinename is not accessible" errors when trying to
	double-click on them.

	Solution: This can be caused by 2 things:
	1) The ipchains rules don't enable forwarding between the pptp connection
	   and the local network.  You should have an ipchains rule like the following
	   (see section 4.1, above, for more information):
	        # Enable packet forwarding to/from the pptpd connection
		# This is the critical rule to allow traffic from the local
		# network to make it to the pptpd connection, and vice versa
	        ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
	2) The ipchains rules are Masquerading before they are forwarding.
	   The 'ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT'
	   must be listed BEFORE any 'ipchains -A forward -j MASQ' rule.

	3) The c:\windows\hosts and c:\windows\lmhosts don't list the proper
	   IP address/machine name connections.  Check to see that all of your local
	   network machines are listed in BOTH of these files on the machine dialing
	   in to the network through Virtual Private Networking.

	Having a properly configured WINS server will also help resolve
	browsing problems.   See the question above about browsing support.

7.3 Server side errors:    

In this section the error is proceeded by where it most likely would be seen.    


	console:  This error would show up on the console    

	    log:  This error would show up in one of the logs (i.e. /var/log/messages)    



7.3.1a. console: createHostSocket: Address already in use    

	or    

7.3.1b. log: MGR:  Couldn't create host socket    


	Possible causes:    

	pptpd is already running.     

	Some other daemon may be using the 1723 port.    


	Possible solutions:    

	1. Use 'ps ax | grep pptpd' to check to see if pptpd is already running.    

	2. Edit /etc/inittab and comment out the reference to pptpd.  The type:    

		init Q    

		pptpd -d    

	3. Reconfigure the other daemon not to use port 1723.    


7.3.2. log:modprobe  cannot locate module ppp-compress-18 (or 21,24, 26)     


	Possible causes:    

	The compression modules for PPP are not loaded    


	Possible solutions:    

	insmod the following modules:ppp_mppe (for 18), bsd_comp (for 21), ppp_deflate (for 24 and 26).    

		or    

	Add the following lines to /etc/conf.modules:
		alias ppp-compress-18 ppp_mppe
		alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
		alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate
		alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate

	Also, make sure you have applied the mppe patches and rebuilt the
	kernel properly.  When everything is compiled properly, you should 
	have the module file /lib/modules/2.2.??/net/ppp_mppe.o.
	(A little side note: if you configure the kernel with ppp support
	built into the kernel, as opposed to modules, then you will not
	have any of the ppp*.o modules, but the support will be built into
	the kernel.  It may be useful to configure this to use modules, however
	because then you can make changes and recompile without having to
	reboot the machine.)

	If no /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/ppp_mppe.c file exists, then you
	haven't applied the mppe patches to the ppp-2.3.?? source, or haven't
	done the "make kernel" step when building ppp-2.3.??.

	If the /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/ppp_mppe.o file exists, but 
	the /lib/modules/2.2.??/net/ppp_mppe.o file does not exist,
	then you probably built the modules, but didn't	install them.
	To install the network driver modules:
		cd /usr/src/linux
		make modules_install SUBDIRS=drivers/net
		depmod -a

	If no ppp_mppe.o file exists, then check your kernel configuration to 
	make sure you have enabled the Network device support->ppp to build
	as a module, and try to rebuild the networking modules using:
		cd /usr/src/linux
		make modules SUBDIRS=drivers/net
		make modules_install SUBDIRS=drivers/net
		depmod -a


7.3.3. log:modprobe  cannot locate module char-major-108    


	Possible causes:    

	The kernel ppp modules are changing in the 2.4.* kernels, and will
	use char-major-108.  pppd knows about this, and checks if
	char-major-108 exists.  When you are using 2.2.* kernels which
	don't have char-major-108, you will get this message.  This doesn't
	cause any problems, but you can hide the message by adding the
	following line to your /etc/conf.modules file:
		alias char-major-108 off    

7.3.4.	Get "pptpd[952]: CTRL: PTY read or GRE write failed"
	errors in your log file

	This indicates that the pppd connection was closed, and doesn't
	necessarily indicate any problem.  You should look at the lines
	immediately preceeding that line to see why the connection was
	closed.  The following is a NORMAL connection termination sequence:

		pppd[23778]: Modem hangup
		pppd[23778]: Connection terminated.
		pppd[23778]: Connect time 27.9 minutes.
		pppd[23778]: Sent 65095 bytes, received 1049035 bytes.
		pppd[23778]: Exit.
		pptpd[23776]: GRE: read error: Bad file descriptor
		pptpd[23776]: CTRL: PTY read or GRE write failed (pty,gre)=(-1,-1)
	
	The following is an abnormal termination due to failing to find
	the pppd program.  The solution is to make sure your pppd program
	is installed and that pptpctrl knows where to find it.  Typically
	pppd would be located in /usr/sbin/pppd.

		pptpd[24089]: CTRL (PPPD Launcher): Failed to launch PPP daemon.
		pptpd[24089]: CTRL: PPPD launch failed!
		pptpd[24088]: Error reading from pppd: Input/output error
		pptpd[24088]: CTRL: GRE read or PTY write failed (gre,pty)=(6,5)

	The following is an abnormal termination due to incorrect options
	in the /etc/ppp/options.pptp (or /etc/ppp/options) file.
	The solution is to correct the pppd options listed in that file.

		pppd[24094]: In file /etc/ppp/options.pptp: unrecognized option 'garbage'
		pptpd[24093]: Error reading from pppd: Input/output error
		pptpd[24093]: CTRL: GRE read or PTY write failed (gre,pty)=(6,5)
	
7.3.5.	Get "pptpd[24120]: GRE: read(fd=5,buffer=804d9c0,len=8196) from
	     PTY failed: status = -1 error = Input/output error"
	    "pptpd[24120]: CTRL: PTY read or GRE write failed (pty,gre)=(5,6)"
	    "pptpd[24120]: CTRL: Client 12.72.37.31 control connection finished"
	errors in your log file when the pptpd program is running on a machine
	behind a masq'ed firewall.

	Solution:  Apply the ip_masq_vpn.patch patch file to kernel.

7.3.6.	Get "pptpd[952]: CTRL: Error with select(), quitting"
	errors in your log file

	This typically is an indication that the other end terminated
	the pptpd control connection.  As with the "GRE read or PTY write
	failed" error message, you should look at the previous lines in
	the /var/log/debug file for an indication of what caused the
	termination.  It may just be a normal call termination.
	If it is an abnormal termination, be sure to also check the client
	side for error messages about why the link was terminated.

7.3.7.	Get "pppd[7359]: Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP"
	errors in your log file

	Solution: Message posted on the pptp-server mailing list:

	Q: I connect and authenticate fine to the PPTP server but when I try to
	ping anything on the subnet I get this error.  Can anyone help me out?

	A: This is a common problem. basically, you have proxyarp as an option
	for pppd. ARP is the mechanism that tcp/ip (and others) use to determine
	if an address is present on the local network or not. For an ip to be
	reachable without routing (present on the local network) it has to be
	in the same subnet as the rest of the computers.

	You have most likely chosen local/remote ip addresses that are not on
	the same subnet as the 'protected' network. There is no point in using
	ARP if your clients are on a different subnet. 

	To fix it, change the local/remote ips to addresses on your protected
	network, or disable proxyarp and use routing to interconnect the
	networks.

	You will also need to be sure that ip forwarding and proxy arp are
	enabled in the kernel.. to do this you do:
	    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/proxy_arp
 
	For routing to work (i.e. to have the local/remote ip addresses NOT
	on the same network as the 'protected' network and interconnect the
	VPN network and the 'protected' network using routing tables),
	the computers on the protected network need to have the linux box
	as a gateway

7.3.8.	Get "pppd[5581]: The remote system is required to authenticate itself"
	    "pppd[5581]: but I couldn't find any suitable secret (password)
		         for it to use to do so."
	errors in your log file

	Solution: Make sure your /etc/ppp/chap-secrets has appropriate
	usernames and passwords in it, that it is "chown root.root" and
	"chmod 600".  If you specify a servername as the second parameter
	in the chap-secrets file, then you must also list that name using
	the "name" parameter in /etc/ppp/options.pptp.

7.3.9.	Get "Sent [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 <asyncmap 0x0> <auth chap 81>
	    <magic 0xe6251907> <pcomp> <accomp>"
	    "...last message repeated 9 times"
	    "LCP: timeout sending Config-Requests"
	errors in your log file

	This typically means the GRE data link is not making it from your
	client to your server, typically because of firewalls.  Remember
	that pptpd requires both a control connection (TCP port 1723) and
	a data connection (GRE protocol = TCP/IP protocol 47).  Check all
	of the firewalls between your two machines to make sure they are
	allowing both types of traffic to pass in both directions.

7.3.10.	Get "CTRL: EOF or bad error reading ctrl packet length."
	    "CTRL: couldn't read packet header (exit)"
	    "CTRL: CTRL read failed"

	Solution: At least 1 report indicates that this problem can be solved
	by installing the Microsoft DUN patches to Windows98SE

7.3.10.	The VPN link works for a while, but then stops working,
	and the /var/log/debug file shows the following:
		pppd[10544]: rcvd [Compressed data] 10 32 ae 68 c0 8e e1 92 ... 

	Solution: Patch the /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/ppp_mppe.c file with
	the patch:

	http://www.vibrationresearch.com/pptpd/ppp_mppe_compressed_data_fix.diff

	and then recompile and reinstall the ppp_mppe.o module

7.3.11. The VPN link works for a while, but then stops working,
	and the /var/log/debug file shows messages like the following:
		pppd[11170]: sent [LCP ProtRej id=0xb 51 19 ...
		pppd[11170]: rcvd [proto=0xbe1b] df 60 4e 4e ...
		pppd[11170]: Unsupported protocol 0xbe1b received
	(where the hex data and the protocol numbers may vary)

	This is probably caused by dropped packets with mppe running in
	stateful mode (i.e. mppe-stateless disabled).  In stateful mode,
	decryption of a packet requires successful decryption of the previous
	packet.  In stateless mode, a packet can always be decrypted as long
	as the sequence number is known.

	Solution: add the "mppe-stateless" option to the /etc/ppp/options.pptp
	file.

7.4 Errors while building pppd, pptpd, and kernel modules

7.4.1.	Get PPP_VERSION or PPP_MAGIC undefined error message while compiling ppp kernel modules

	Solution: add the following lines to /usr/src/linux/include/linux/if_ppp.h
		#define PPP_VERSION "2.3.11"
		#define PPP_MAGIC   0x5002  /* Magic value for the ppp structure */

7.4.2.	Get "structure has no member named `tty_pushing'" error messages while compiling ppp kernel modules

	This is probably because the mppe patches you used were for an older version
	of the kernel, and the ppp structure in the header file if_pppvar.h changed
	in the version of the kernel you have.

	Solution: apply the patch http://www.vibrationresearch.com/pptpd/if_ppp_2.2.17.diff
		to the kernel sources.

7.4.3.	Get symbols not defined for ppp_mppe module when doing "depmod -a"

	Solution: Quick answer is you probably followed instructions to 
	comment out the '#include "rc4_skey.c"' line from the file
	linux/drivers/net/ppp_mppe.c when it should have been left in.
	If you are using the rc4* sources from SSLeay-0.9.0, you must
	NOT comment out this line, and you must also make sure the
	rc4_skey.c file gets copied from the SSLeay sources into the
	linux/drivers/net directory.

	Longer answer is: you probably are missing some of the rc4* files
	(most likely rc4_skey.c)  This typically happens when getting rc4*
	files from a different source than was suggested in the corresponding
	patch file.  If I remember right, if you use the SSLeay-0.6.6 files
	you don't have an rc4_skey.c file and must comment out the #include
	that references it.  If you use the SSLeay-0.9.0 files you will have
	the rc4_skey.c file, and must NOT comment out the #include line.
	Using OpenSSL-0.9.5 may have different requirements.
	The best solution is to use the complete patch for your appropriate
	ppp version from the following ftp server, as these patches include
	the rc4* files:
		ftp://ftp.binarix.com/pub/ppp-mppe/

7.4.4.	Get other errors after applying kernel patches for ppp_mppe.

	Make sure your patch files are in Unix format (and not DOS format)
	before you apply the patches.  The dos2unix utility will do this
	conversion.

	If the patch files are in DOS format, the line continuation escapes
	(i.e. \<LF>) will turn into (\<CR><LF>) which is no longer a line
	continuation escape code.
