Version 1.4.1

 . klogd will set the console log level only if `-c' is given on the
   commandline, not overwriting local settings in `/etc/sysctl.conf'.
 . Bugfix: klogd will use SOCK_DGRM as well, re-enables kernel logging
 . Bugfix: Don't make syslogd fail with broken `-a'
 . Bugfix: klogd will skip zero bytes and not enter a busy loop anymore
 . Thomas Roessler <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
   - Patch to prevent LogLine() from being invoked with a negative
     counter as an argument.

Version 1.4

 . Skip newline when reading in klog messages
 . Use lseek64() instead of llseek() which is deprecated these days
 . Close symbol file before returning with 0 when an error occurred
   while reading it.  This will enable systems to umount that
   partition with no open file descriptor left over.

   - printline() fixes
   - priority decoding fix
 . Daniel Jacobowitz <dan@debian.org>
   - printchopped() fix
 . Keith Owens <kaos@ocs.com.au>
   - Fixed bug that caused klogd to die if there is no sym_array available.
   - When symbols are expanded, print the line twice.  Once with
     addresses converted to symbols, once with the raw text.  Allows
     external programs such as ksymoops do their own processing on the
     original data.
 . Olaf Kirch <okir@caldera.de>
   - Remove Unix Domain Sockets and switch to Datagram Unix Sockets
 . Several bugfixes and improvements, please refer to the .c files
